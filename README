This repository is for some simple programs
with stereoscopic visualisation, for "red-blue" glasses,
of 3D models consisting of line segments.

It would be nice to have these programs in the protable
format.
Thus, HTML and Javascript are prefered tools for their 
creatiom.

The first approach is somwhat "experimental" application
of SVG for this purpose.
