<h3>User interface manual</h3>

<p> 
RedBlueLines lets you view and design skeletons consisting of the segments with the endpoints on a 3D grid contained in a cube.
To take full advantage of the RedBlueLines editor you have to enable 'pop-up windows'.
</p>
<p> 
You can switch between stereoscopic and "monoscopic" view mode ('E').
To work in the stereoscopic mode you need standard red-blue glasses 
(with the red one on the left eye and the blue one on the right eye).
</p>
<p> 
You can toggle the visibility and mobility of the cursor ('M').
If the cursor is visible, then you can also see the square  that is the intersection of the cube with
one of the cursor-containing XY, XZ, or YZ planes (the one which is "most parallel" to the screen).
In "cursor-moving" (the larger cursor) mode you can move the cursor on the square with arrow keys. 
You can also move the whole square backward or forward ('B' or 'F').
In "cursor-visible" (the smaller cursor) mode you can rotate the editing cube 
and the square is updated automatically.  
In cursor moving mode: clicking a mouse moves the cursor on the square towards the mouse pointer.
In the other modes, clicking a mouse on the projection screen switches the 'rotation mode' on/off.
In the 'rotation mode' the edited object is being rotated as the mouse is being moved.
</p>
<p>
You can switch the "linking mode" on ('+') or off ('-').
In the linking mode you can see a "linking line" between the current and the previous position
of the cursor. You can insert a new segment identical to the linking line ('+').
You can also use the linking line to select existing segment identical to the line ('S').
</p>

<p>
The following actions can be performed by mouse-clicking on the icon or pressing a keyboard key
with the corresponding symbol:
<ul>
<dt>'?'</dt>
<dd> - open the help page (in a separate pop-up window)</dd>

<dt>'L', Space </dt>
<dd> - adjust the rotation to the right angles </dd>

<dt>'E'</dt>
<dd> - switch between stereoscopic and 'mono-scopic' view </dd>

<dt>'M'</dt>
<dd> - change the cursor moving and visibility modes</dd>

<dt>'+', Enter, double mouse click in the same place</dt>
<dd> - switch on the linking mode </dd>
<dd> - in the linking mode: insert new segment </dd>

<dt>'-', Escape</dt>
<dd> - switch off the linking mode </dd>


<dt>'J'</dt>
<dd> - let the cursor jump to the nearest endpoint <dd>

<dt>'#', Delete</dt>
<dd> - remove the selected segments </dd>

<dt>'S'</dt>
<dd> - in the linking mode: toggle the selection of the segment </dd>

<dt>'*'</dt>
<dd> - select the segments incident to the cursor</dd>

<dt>'A'</dt>
<dd> - select all segments </dd>

<dt>'X'</dt>
<dd> - toggle the selection of each segment </dd>

<dt>'B', 'F', Arrow keys</dt>
<dd> - either move the cursor or rotate the object, depending on the 'cursor moving mode'</dd>

<dt>'D'</dt>
<dd> - dump the text of the current state of the editor and data. 
This text can be copy-pasted to your text editor and saved as
a SVG document (a text file with a name suffix ".svg"), which can be resumed later in the web browser
for viewing or editing.
This is the way of saving your work, since JavaScript does not have direct access to your file system.
</dd>
</ul>
</p>

<h3> Warnings </h3>
<p>
Be aware that in the current version of RedBlueLines:
<ul>
<li> There is no "undo" operation.</li>
<li> You can loose your changes without warning (e.g. by going out of the page, closing the window, closing the browser, and so on ...).
Use the dump operation ('D') liberally to store current states of the data. 
The dumped data is stamped with the exact date and time of its creation. 
</li> 
<li> Two or more collinear intersecting segments are visible as a single segment. (You may try to use 'J', to detect their endpoints.)  </li>
</ul>
</p>
